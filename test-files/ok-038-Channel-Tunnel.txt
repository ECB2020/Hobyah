Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
June 2024
This is a simple model of the Channel Tunnel.  Two running tunnels,
(both crossover doors closed), 193 pressure relief ducts (PRDs) at
250 m intervals except at the two crossovers, supplementary ventilation
system (SVS) at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte.

No service tunnel, escape cross-passages or normal ventilation system (NVS).
No consideration of the Castle Hill cut and cover tunnels and the rail
turnouts they contain (that's why there are too many PRDs).
No changes of area: the entire length of both running tunnels is treated
as if it were the 7.6 m internal diameter (ID) bored tunnel.

The SVS is running ventilation with supply at Sangatte to running
tunnel south (RTS) and extract at Shakespeare Cliff from RTS.
The airflows take about 500 seconds to settle down.  At that point,
someone in the control room notices that all the PRDs are still open
(oops) and closes them.  This leads to an interesting set of airflow
and pressure fluctuations as the flow in both running tunnels adjusts.

The main reason for building it is to illustrate the combined use of
the "joins" keyword to create multiple adits and the "tunnelclones"
block.

Four lines of "joins" and a ten-line "tunnelclones" block created 193
PRDs that are indistinguishable from the same tunnels if they had been
defined in 193 individual "tunnel" blocks.

Cloned tunnels are not true clones: they can be given different
sectypes by creating a list of the names of sectypes.  In this example,
all the PRDs have a sectype named "open" except PRDs 100 and 101,
which have a sectype named "closed".

When a set of cloned tunnels is created, the commands required to
create the cloned tunnels are written to the log file as "begin tunnel...
end tunnel" blocks.  These can be copied into the input file and
customised in ways not available in the "tunnelclones" block.

Length, area and perimeter of the Channel Tunnel are from:
 Henson, D A and Lowndes, J F F L,  "The use of fluid dynamics calculations
 in the design of the Channel Tunnel", Proc. 1st International Conference on
 Computer Applications in Transportation Systems, ITC, 1996.

Friction factor of the running tunnels is from:
  Creedy, D P, Smith, P R and Goodhead, N R, “Measurement of the
  resistances of the UK landward running and service tunnels for TML”,
  British Coal TSRE report, 1992.

  They concluded that the running tunnel had an area of 41.3 m^2 and a
  resistance of 0.00015 ±0.00002 gauls per 100 metres, which is approximately
  a Fanning friction c_f = 0.0066 (Darcy friction factor lambda = 0.0264).
  The equivalent fully-turbulent roughness (using Henson's area and
  perimeter) by Colebrook's approximation is 0.0196 m.

Details of the approximate crossover locations are from data on charts
in "The Channel Tunnel, A Designer's Perspective", Mott MacDonald,
privately published (in 1995, I think).
