Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
This file demonstrates a known bug in Hobyah (hence the 'kb' at the
start of the filename).

The bug occurs when the outflow pressure loss factor at a portal is very
high.

This file has two almost-identical tunnels, each 500 m long with a
pressure difference of 490 Pa.

One tunnel has a pressure loss factor (zeta) of 153 set at a loss
part-way along the tunnel; its calculation works.
The other tunnel has zeta = 153 set at the portal and it fails (it
violates conservation of mass in the gridpoint at the portal).

The problem seems to be in the routines that calculate celerity and
velocity at the gridpoints just inside a pressure portal.  There are
two such routines: OpenEnd and PortalCelerity.

The routine PortalCelerity calculates the celerity at the portal that
matches the air velocity in the tunnel (given a reservoir of fixed
celerity and zero velocity outside the portal).

The routine OpenEnd calculates one backwards characteristic and pairs
it with the values calculated by PortalCelerity.  It iterates to
calculate new values of c_N and u_N.

When the pressure loss factors at the portals are large enough, successive
estimates of air velocity u_N and celerity c_N hunt, and the calculation
at the gridpoint does not converge.  The count of iterations times out
and the routine returns whatever value it happened to be on at the last
iteration.

The cyclic nature of the bug can be looked into by searching for the
boolean variable "debug_kb_001" (without double quotes) in Hobyah.py
and setting it to True instead of False.  This causes the program to
print a set of debug statements showing the values in those functions.
Note that you will need to use the command-line switch to tell Hobyah
not to use the Fortran routines, as the debug statements are only in
the equivalent Python routines.  The command-line syntax is:
