Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
This has one tunnel and tests out the setting of friction factors.
This has a relative roughness of 0.02 and uses the approximation in
the SES v4.1 source code "OMEGA5.FOR", lines 260 & 261.
The calculated friction factor at the first gridpoint is 0.0120006,
1.3% lower than the exact value of 0.0121645.
Resulting air velocities are 7.140-7.143 m/s.
