Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
This file created to test the processing of fans.  There is one tunnel
with three fans in series and a pressure loss.  The fans start and stop
at different times.  The file is not a practical system, it is to show
how fans in series can be forced into the backward flow region of their
characteristic and the freewheeling part of their characteristic.

The best way to understand what is happening is to run the file then
open the pdf file "ok-031-fan-test-lp1.pdf".  Treat that pdf file as a
flip book and flip back and forwards through its pages, or look at the
associated .gif file.

At 10 seconds one fan starts running in reverse at half speed, generating
a low negative air flow in the tunnel.  Fan 1 takes 15 seconds to start.

At 100 seconds a second fan start running in forwards mode at full speed
(fan 2 also takes 15 seconds to start).  At first it is in the reverse flow
region of its characteristic, due to the pressure rise of the first fan.
But as its speed increases it successfully overcomes the first fan, forcing
that fan into the flow reversal region of its characteristic (-ve flow,
+ve pressure).  The flow reversal region was not defined in fan 1's
characteristic, so the conditions are defined by extrapolating the first
two points on the fan characteristic (in the plots there is a small gap
between the line representing the extrapolated characteristic and the
defined characteristic, just to drive home to users that the program is
extrapolating).

Between 114 and 116 seconds fan 2 (which reaches full speed at 115 s)
passes through the stall hump in its characteristic.  The MoC calculation
really struggles here.  The duty point hunts up and down the stall
part of the characteristic, eventually ending up just to the right of
the stall region.  This is due to numerical instability - the solution
did not reach convergence and the calculation stopped after the maximum
number of iterations was reached.  It looks exactly like the behaviour
of a fan hunting in stall, but the underlying cause is not the same.  Real
Life runs on a much more robust physics engine than software.

If you look at the log file or the runtime transcript in Terminal, there
will be messages warning you that the calculation failed to converge at
a handful of timesteps, all near 115 seconds:
> scipy.optimize warned about fan "2" at 115.1 sec:
  The iteration is not making good progress, as measured by the
  improvement from the last five Jacobian evaluations.
> scipy.optimize warned about fan "2" at 115.15 sec:
  The iteration is not making good progress, as measured by the
  improvement from the last five Jacobian evaluations.
You can see the effect of this as a small wiggle in the velocity in the
top left graph around the 115 seconds mark, and the way the duty point
of fan 2 jumps back and forwards as it crosses the stall point.  These
are examples of instabilities that are not a concern.


At 150 seconds the first fan stops running in reverse.  Free of being
dragged down by fan 1, fan 2 moves to the right on its characteristic,
away from the stall region and into a part of the characteristic that
is probably a bit too far to the right to be at the fan's peak
efficiency zone.

At 220 seconds a third fan starts, running in forwards mode at 60% speed.
The third fan is immediately forced into the windmilling region of its
characteristic (+ve flow, -ve pressure) and as a result reduces the flow
through the tunnel.  The windmilling region is not defined so the
conditions are defined by extrapolating the last two points on the fan
total pressure characteristic.

When a fan is not running in the simulation is it treated as having zero
pressure loss.  This does not happen in the real world (in reality when
fan 2 is running by itself energy would be drained by fan 1 and fan 3
windmilling in the airstream).

The fact that this test case doesn't crash is genuinely surprising.
It shows just how stable the method of characteristics is.
Also, if I had been able to flick back and forward through the pdf file
"ok-031-fans-in-series-lp1.pdf" when I was a wet-behind-the-ears graduate,
it would have massively improved my understanding of how fans behave.

N.B. There is nothing in the calculation that could handle the beneficial
pressure-multiplying effect of contrarotating fans.  You'll need to
define a "begin fanchar"..."end fanchar" block that has their combined
characteristic.

Note that this is one of the few files in which there are differences in
how the Python code calculates and the Fortran code calculates.  The
differences occur at 115 to 125 seconds, when fan 2 is crossing the fan
characteristic's stall hump.
