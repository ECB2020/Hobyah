# Hobyah test files

The files in this folder are Hobyah input files (.txt files) that run calculations, generate output in text or .pdf format, and (optionally) write SES input files.

Other files in this folder are ancillary files.  Ancillary files are could be:
  * .csv files with data that a Hobyah input file needs (test data, fan curves),
  * .png files that a Hobyah "image" block imports,
  * .sbn files (binary files with SES output written by SESconv.py) that a Hobyah input file plots from and
  * .hbn files (binary files with Hobyah output written by Hobyah.py) that a Hobyah input file plots from,
  * .pdf files that a Hobyah run generates and
  * .ses, .INP or .SIN files that a Hobyah run generates from a Hobyah geometry.

The Hobyah test files all start with "ok-" and a three-digit number ("ok-001" to "ok-048" and (optionally) a descriptive phrase.
