Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
December 2020
This raises fault call 2062 in PROC GetBegins.  It has two blocks
that define plot files ("begin files nicknames", "begin files numbered"
and "begin files 2syllables").
Defining more than one block of plot files is not allowed, though it isn't
caught in the syntax checker.
