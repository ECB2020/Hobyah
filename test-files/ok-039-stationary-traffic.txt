Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
A file that tests the development of road traffic.  Has a twin-tube
road tunnel, one side of which has an offslip tunnel.

The traffic is set by defining routes, defining traffic types, then
defining blocks that set stationary traffic in those routes.

Traffic at standstill can use vehicle densities in PCU/lane-km or in
veh/lane-km.  Both are tested here.  Two routes are told to use traffic
at 165 PCU/lane-km and the code works out the correct mix of traffic
from the numbers given - you don't have to figure it out vehicle
densities at standstill yourself.

There is traffic in five routes:

 * Route 'EBmain' has stationary traffic that starts inside one
   tunnel  and stops part way along the second tunnel.  The second
   tunnel is backwards in the route.

 * Route 'EBbranch' has stationary traffic that starts at the node
   joining the first and second tunnels, fills the second tunnel
   entirely and stops part way along the third tunnel, which is
   forwards in the route.

 * Routes 'up' and 'down' pass through the same tunnel (a bidirectional
   tunnel) but the two routes don't share lanes.
   Both routes have stationary traffic that forms a queue on either
   side of a blockage (this can happen with traffic collisions in
   narrow bidirectional tunnels; vehicles arrive from both directions
   but can't get past).

 * Route 'Dud' has stationary traffic that starts and stops outside
   the tunnels.  It is also a check that setting the density of
   stationary traffic in veh/lane-km gives the same result as setting
   it in PCU/lane-km. The 'Dud' route and the 'WB' route have the same
   traffic mix, but in one the 'standstill' keyword uses PCU/lane-km
   and the other uses veh/lane-km.

Lines written to the screen and the log file verify that the code
behaves as it should and correctly converts from route chainages to
tunnel distances.
