Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
A file that verifies the development of jet fan types.

There is a "jetfantypes" block with unidirectional and reversible
jet fans and two tunnels with jet fans in them.

The first tunnel has three active banks of jet fans, all of which
deliver their thrust to the air over a distance of 80 m.  Three
jet fans run in forwards mode at one end of the tunnel and one
runs in reverse at the other end.  This is a typical "pressurise
the non-incident tunnel to prevent smoke getting into the open
cross-passages" jet fan operation.

The second tunnel is similar to the first.  The only difference
is that the jet fans in this tunnel deliver their pressure rise
over one cell of the calculation instead of 80 m.  This way of
treating how jet fans set tunnel pressure profiles is how it is
done in most other programs (e.g. Camatt, IDA, Aero).

The pressure profiles of the two tunnel illustrate what this means.
Consider an open escape cross-passage at chainage 11120.  In the
first calculation the air pressure in the non-incident tunnel is
around zero Pascals.  In the second tunnel (with the step change
in pressure at jet fans), the air pressure in the non-incident
tunnel is +12 Pascals, a much more comfortable figure to have in
the non-incident tunnel when there is a risk of smoke from the
incident tunnel entering the cross-passage.
