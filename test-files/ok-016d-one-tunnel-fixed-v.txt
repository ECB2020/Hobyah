Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
This has one tunnel with an exit portal and an entry portal and runs a
calculation.  This case has a fixed outflow velocity of 5 m/s at the forward
portal.  The calculation forces the portal pressure to be whatever is
needed.

In order to prevent the worst type of calculation explosions from
occurring, the fixed values are not imposed in the first timestep but
are ramped up from zero to the fixed value in two seconds.  This time
can be adjusted by the entry "risetime" in the settings block.

This run also plots the results of all four runs.

The transient behaviour of the calculations differs significantly.
This is because in two calculations (016a and 016b) the air in the
tunnel is pressurised in order to generate the flow and in the other
two runs (016c and 016d) the air in the tunnel is depressurised to
generate the flow.
