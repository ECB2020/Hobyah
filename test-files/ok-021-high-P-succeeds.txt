Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
This has one tunnel with an exit portal and an entry portal.  The air
pressure at the entry portal is so high that the air velocity in the
tunnel is so high (18 kPa) that the stability criterion of the method of
characteristics (MoC) calculation would fail if the default cell size
was used.  In this run the cell size has been set longer to avoid
the problem occurring.

This file should be compared to the file called "ok-020-high-P-fails.txt".

There is one difference between the calculation in these two files.
In this file the optional setting "max_vel" has been set high enough
that the cells in the MoC calculation are long enough to keep the base
of the forward characteristic inside the length of one cell.
