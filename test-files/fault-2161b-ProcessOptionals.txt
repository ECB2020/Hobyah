Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
December 2020
This has a sections block with optional entries.  One of the entries
triggers fault 2161 because there is no key before the assignment
second operator :=.  This is a variant error message because the
phrase "option1 := option2" has been consumed, leaving ":= option3"
at the start of the line.
