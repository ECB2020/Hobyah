Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program
December 2020
Tests an error message in PROC ProcessBlock where
we have an invalid definition of what we want (i.e. not strings
beginning with "int", "float" or "#name" or a tuple in the code).
This error should only be raised during development work.
This test file raises it at the top level of processing.
It also checks that all the number rules are all tested correctly.
