Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.

This has three tunnels and runs a calculation.

One tunnel case has a fixed pressure outside one portal, one tunnel
has a fixed velocity at one portal and one tunnel has a fixed volume
flow at one portal.  All end up at the same condition (air velocity
7.5 m/s), but the way they get to the condition differs.  The two
tunnels with fixed velocity/fixed volume flow experience large pressure
fluctuations due to the calculation needing high pressures to get the
flow going in the first few seconds then seeing pressure waves rush
back and forward along their tunnels.  The tunnel with the fixed
pressure sees a much smoother rise, although there are some visible
pressure fluctuations in the first few seconds.

The pressure to set at the portal was calculated as follows:

 * Desired velocity is v_t = 7.5 m/s.
 * Duct has area 20 m^2, perimeter 18 m, length 350 m and fixed Fanning
   friction factor c_f = 0.005.
 * Inlet portal has zeta_in = 0.5 (default) and outflow portal has
   zeta_out = 1.0 (default).
 * Outside air density is 1.2 kg/m^3.
 * Friction loss term is zeta_fric = c_f * perimeter * length / area
                                   = 0.005 * 18 * 350 / 20
                                   = 1.575
 * Total loss term zeta_tot = zeta_in + zeta_out + zeta_fric
                            = 0.5 + 1.0 + 1.575
                            = 3.075
 * Required pressure is 1/2 * rho * zeta_tot * v_t^2
                      = 1.2 * 1.2 * 3.075 * 7.5^2
                      = 103.78125 Pa.

The above calculation ignores the density changes inside the tunnel
as the air in the tunnel is compressed from 101.33 kPa to 101.43 kPa,
but that effect is small enough to not matter.
