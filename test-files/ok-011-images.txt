Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
A test of the various ways of putting images onto the pages of a Hobyah plot.

This file has two graphs and eight images.  The graphs and images are
plotted in the sequence they appear in the file.  The first item is a
graph at the top of the page. Next, eight images are overlaid on top of it.
Finally, a second graph is plotted at the bottom of the page, overlaid
on top of the images.  Some of the images overlay the first graph and the
second graph overlays some of the images: this is all down to the sequence
in which they all appear in the input file.

1) Images can be set out from one of five base points and an associated
   height or width.  They are:
     * "leftbase" - X and Y coordinates of the bottom left hand corner of
       the image.
       Either of the image width or image height can be set (not both).

     * "midbase" - X coordinate halfway across the image width and Y coordinate
       at the base of the image.
       The image width must be set, not the height.

     * "rightbase" - X and Y coordinates of the bottom right hand corner of
       the image.
       The image width must be set, not the height.

     * "leftmid" - X coordinate of the left edge of the image and Y coordinate
       halfway up the image height.
       The image height must be set, not the width.

     * "lefttop" - X and Y coordinates of the top right hand corner of
       the image.
       The image height must be set, not the width.

2) The are two ways of setting the size of the image: set the width or set
   the height.

3) There is an optional entry to turn on a border around the image (it is
   off by default).

4) There is an optional entry to set the aspect ratio (height/width) of the
   image on the page.
   * The default is to use the image's natural aspect ratio, i.e. if an
     image has a height of 400 pixels and a width of 600 pixels it shows
     a wide, short rectangle on the page with an aspect ratio of 0.667.
     This is also what happens when the user sets an aspect ratio of -1
     or does not set an aspect ratio (because the default aspect ratio is -1).
   * If the user sets an aspect ratio of 1 the image will be forced into a
     square on the page.
   * If the user sets an aspect ratio under 1 the image will be wide and short.
   * If the user sets an aspect ratio over 1 the image will be narrow and tall.

5) If an image file is not available, a square with a cross in it will
   be shown in the image's approximate location.

A note about the images used here: they are all of Hobyahs, scanned from the
1894 edition of the tale and drawn by illustrator John D. Batten.  The source
is at archive.org:

Note that the file paths to the images may need to be edited to work
on others' systems.

    # The keyword "leftbase" means that the user is setting the location

    # corner).
    # It has a .. in the filename, which is used to reference a file in
    # the folder one level above the folder that holds the input file.

    # It is better to use relative folder references (as in the image above)
    # or use the tilde symbol (~) to represent the user's home folder (on
    # macOS) or the user's home drive and home folder (on Windows).

    # The keyword "midbase" means that the user is setting the location

    # width is needed so that gnuplot can figure out where the bottom-left
    # corner is.
    # No path is given in the file name, so it will look for the image
    # in the folder that this input file is in (which is not necessarily
    # the same as the current working directory).
    # The optional argument "namecheck := on" means that the name of this
    # image file will be in the footer.  The argument is best used when
    # an image is important, like a scan of a graph of test data from a
    # technical paper.  It is not recommended for images like company
    # logos, which would be a distraction if they were namechecked in
    # the QA data.
