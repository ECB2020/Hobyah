Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program
June 2020
This file has two sub-sub-sub-blocks with the same name in the
same sub-sub-block.  It shows that the recursive calls to
CheckSubDictClashes work and detect the clash.

Note that it correctly does not find a clash between a
sub-sub-block named "begin heights" and a sub-sub-sub-block
also named "begin heights". Clashes can only occur when they
are at the same level.

That last was a bit of a torture test for the program.  We have
no intention of defining gradients and heights at multiple
levels.
Real input files will probably get to about five levels of
nesting:
  a block for plots,
  a sub-block for a page,
  a sub-sub-block for a graph,
  a sub-sub-sub-block for the curves on the graph,
  and a sub-sub-sub-sub-block for custom data in a curve.
