Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program
December 2020
Tests an error message in PROC ProcessBlock where
we have an invalid definition of what we want (i.e. not strings
beginning with "int", "float" or "#name" or a tuple in the code).
This error should only be raised during development work.
This test file raises it at the second level of processing,
after reading a valid word that requires any word and a number
after the word.
