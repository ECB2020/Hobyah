Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
This has one tunnel with an exit portal and an entry portal.  The air
air pressure at the entry portal is so high that the air velocity in
the tunnel is so high (18 kPa) that the stability criterion of the method of
characteristics (MoC) calculation fails, at which point the calculation
explodes.  The run is stopped just before the calculation causes an
overflow.

This file should be compared to the file called "ok-020-high-P-fails.txt".

There is one difference between the calculation in these two files.
In "ok-021-high-P-succeeds.txt" the optional setting "max_vel" has
been set high enough that the cells in the MoC calculation are
long enough to keep the base of the forward characteristic inside
the length of one cell.  In this file, the default value is used,
the cells are slightly too short and the calculation blows up.
