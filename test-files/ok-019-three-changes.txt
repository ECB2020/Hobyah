Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
A test file that has four tunnels, each with three changes of sectype.
One is an expansion, one changes to the same area and one is a
contraction:

The purpose of this file is to show that the pressure losses at portals
and at changes of sectype in the compressible calculation are correct
regardless of the orientations and flow directions.  The comments in
this file compare the values of pressure drop from the compressible
calculations to incompressible hand calculations (they do match).

Two tunnels have airflow from back end to forward end, the other two have
airflow from forward end to back end.  The airflow is driven by a fixed
gauge pressure of +20 Pa outside the inflow portal a fixed gauge pressire
of -20 Pa outside the outflow portal.  The pressures are near zero so that
the effect of compressibility is minimised, so that the pressure drops can
be compared to what they would be in an incompressible calculation with
density 1.2 kg/m^3.

Explicit fixed losses are set at portals and changes of sectype (i.e. at
each end of each segment).

In the first two tunnels all the fixed losses are non-zero, in the third
and fourth tunnels they are as follows, for the two flow directions:

     Segment 1                                                 Segment 4

The inlet portal has a fixed gauge pressure of +20 Pa, the outflow
portal has a fixed pressure gauge pressure of -20 Pa.  The file runs
for 500 seconds, long enough to get all four tunnels to steady state.

The pressure profiles at the last timestep are correct.
In the tunnels with zero fixed losses the only losses are due to to
friction.

Some observations of the pressure profiles in the two tunnels with no
pressure losses on the first page of the .pdf file
"ok-019-three-changes.pdf":
 * At the entry portals the total pressure inside is +20 Pa (because the
   entry loss is zero).
 * At the exit portal the total pressure is -20 Pa (because there
   is no pressure loss at the exit).
 * There is no change of total pressure across the three junctions.
 * The change of static pressure across the junctions is only due
   to changes in dynamic pressure.


Some observations of the pressure profiles on the second page of the
.pdf file "ok-019-three-changes.pdf" (which has fixed pressure losses):

 * At the inflow portals the total pressure inside is less than +20 Pa
   and is set by inflow pressure losses.  The equivalent incompressible
   calculations are:
    Mainline3 inflow: zeta_in = zeta_bf = 0.92,
                            air velocity is 2.473 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 0.92 * 2.473**2 = 3.375 Pa
                    P_tot in the first cell should be:
                         P_tot = 101325 + 20 - 3.375 = 101341.625 Pa
                     Value in the compressible calc is 101341.624 Pa

    Mainline4 inflow: zeta_in = zeta_fb = 0.83,
                             air velocity is -2.140 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 0.83 * 2.140**2 = 2.281 Pa
                    P_tot in the last cell should be:
                         P_tot = 101325 + 20 - 2.281 = 101342.719 Pa
                     Value in the compressible calc is 101342.719 Pa

 * At the outflow portals the total pressure inside is higher than -20 Pa
   and set by outflow pressure losses.  The equivalent incompressible
   calculations are:
    Mainline3 outflow: zeta_out = zeta_fb = 2.13,
                            air velocity is 2.167 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 2.13 * 2.167**2 = 6.001 Pa
                    P_tot in the last cell should be:
                         P_tot = 101325 - 20 + 6.001 = 101311.001 Pa
                     Value in the compressible calc is 101311.001 Pa

    Mainline4 outflow: zeta_out = zeta_bf = 1.7,
                            air velocity is -2.443 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 1.7 * 2.443**2 = 6.088 Pa
                    P_tot in the first cell should be:
                         P_tot = 101325 - 20 + 6.88 = 101311.087 Pa
                    Value in the compressible calc is 101311.087 Pa

 * At the change of sectype at chainage 10200 the step change in
   total pressure is set by back-to-forward pressure loss factors
   (zeta_bf) and forward-to-back pressure loss factors (zeta_fb).
   These apply to the air velocity in the smaller of the two areas
   on either side of the change.

     In Mainline3: zeta_bf = 0.31, air velocity is 3.121 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 0.31 * 3.160**2 = 1.857 Pa
      Compressible calc DP = 101328.701 - 101326.843 = 1.858 Pa

     In Mainline4: zeta_fb = 0.41, air velocity is -3.121 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 0.41 * 3.121**2 = 2.396 Pa
         Compressible calc DP = 101332.574 - 101329.008 = 2.397 Pa


 * At the change of sectype at chainage 10300 the sectype on each
   side of the change is the same.

     In Mainline3: zeta_bf = 0.51, air velocity is 3.160 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 0.51 * 3.160**2 = 3.056 Pa
      Compressible calc DP = 101323.857 - 101320.801 = 3.056 Pa

     In Mainline4: zeta_fb = 0.61, air velocity is -3.121 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 0.61 * -3.121**2 = 3.565 Pa
       Compressible calc DP = 101332.574 - 101329.008 = 3.566 Pa

  back 10000 portal  20 West    zeta_out := 1.7  zeta_in := 0.92
  fwd  10600 portal -20         zeta_out := 2.13 zeta_in := 0.83
  change 10200 Mid              zeta_bf := 0.31   zeta_fb := 0.41
  change 10300 Mid              zeta_bf := 0.51   zeta_fb := 0.61
  change 10400 East             zeta_bf := 0.71   zeta_fb := 0.81


 * At the change of sectype at chainage 10400:

     In Mainline3: zeta_bf = 0.71, air velocity is 3.160 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 0.71 * 3.160**2 = 4.254 Pa
      Compressible calc DP = 101317.815 - 101313.561 = 4.254 Pa

     In Mainline4: zeta_fb = 0.81, air velocity is -3.121 m/s.
                    DP = 0.5 * 1.2 * 0.81 * 3.121**2 = 4.734 Pa
      Compressible calc DP = 101340.222 - 101335.487 = 2.735 Pa

So the incompressible hand calculations match the compressible
calculations as near as can be expected.
