Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
A file that verifies the development of road traffic.  It has three tunnels.

Two have blocks of stationary traffic 80 m long (the length of two cells
in the MoC calculation). Other losses (portal losses and friction)
are minimised.  The first tunnel has the block of traffic start and end
at gridpoints (the locations at which the program calculates its values
of celerity and velocity).  The second tunnel has the block of traffic
start halfway between gridpoints.  This is to check for grid-independence
with blocks of traffic drag.

The third tunnel has the equivalent loss of the traffic drag set as
friction instead, as a check.

Discussion of tunnels one and two (which have blocks of traffic)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a hand calculation that replicates the program's traffic
drag calculation.

  There are three types of traffic: cars, light commercial vehicles (LCV)
  and heavy goods vehicles (HGV).

  The routes that the traffic is in (routes one and two) have the following
  "flowrates" of traffic: 1600 cars/hr, 205 LCVs/hr and 291 HGVs/hr.
  The traffic density in both routes is 165 PCU/lane-km: one car is 1 PCU,
  one LCV is also 1 PCU and 1 HGV is 3 PCU (below 10 km/h).

  The mean PCU value is
            1*1600 + 1*205 + 3*291   2678
            ---------------------- = ---- = 1.277767 PCU/veh
              1600 + 205 + 291       2096

  The routes have two lanes (see the definitions of routes one and two).

  The density of traffic is 165 PCU/lane-km (see the trafficsteady
  block named "stopped").
  165 PCU/lane-km * 2 lanes = 330 PCU/km.
  This is equivalent to 330 / 1.277767 = 258.2823 veh/km.

  The mix of vehicles is as follows (see the trafficsteady block "stopped"):

    cars: 1600 / 2096 * 258.2823 = 197.1621 cars/km
    LCVs:  205 / 2096 * 258.2823 =  25.2614 LCVs/km
    HGVs:  291 / 2096 * 258.2823 =  35.8588 HGVs/km

  The block of stationary traffic is 80 m long (0.08 km), so the following
  counts of vehicles are in the tunnel:

    cars: 1600 / 2096 * 258.2823 * 0.08 = 15.7730 cars
    LCVs:  205 / 2096 * 258.2823 * 0.08 =  2.0209 LCVs
    HGVs:  291 / 2096 * 258.2823 * 0.08 =  2.8687 HGVs

  The "traffictypes" block sets the properties of traffic types, as
  follows:
   * Cars have drag factor 0.4 and area 2 m^2,
   * LCVs have drag factor 0.9 and area 4 m^2,
   * HGVs have drag factor 1.0 and area 6 m^2.
  The blockage correction term (1 - A_veh/A_tunnel)^2 is not being used:
  the drag factors are assumed to already account for it.


  The block of traffic is in a tunnel of area 103 m^2.  The dimensionless
  drag coefficient of the block of traffic is calculated as follows:

               0.4 * 2 * 15.7730  +  0.9 * 4 * 2.0209  +  1.0 * 6 * 2.8687
  zeta_traff = -----------------------------------------------------------
                              103

               12.6184  +  7.2753  +  17.2122
             = ------------------------------
                           103

             = 0.36025 on 103 m^2.

  In the program's printout (sent to the screen and to the log file)
  it records the value as drag factor zeta per metre of tunnel length.
  In this case it is 0.36095 / 80 = 0.00450314 zeta/m.

  The tables of data printed to the screen during the run and stored in
  the log file match the above calculation.


In tunnel two, the block of traffic happens to start and stop exactly
at the gridpoints (the gridpoints are spaced 40 m apart).

In tunnel three the block of traffic starts and stops halfway between
the gridpoints.  The purpose of this difference is to test whether the
location of a block of traffic affects the calculated results.


The results (page 1 of the pdf file plotted by this run) shows that
all is well.  The pressure profiles only differ across the gridpoints
next to the ends of the blocks of traffic and the air velocities in
tunnels one and two outside the traffic blocks match as follows:

* air velocity at the left end of tunnel one is 13.601616 m/s
* air velocity at the left end of tunnel two is 13.601621 m/s

The difference is 0.00004%, so we can conclude that the drag of blocks
of stationary traffic are independent of the location of the traffic
with respect to the gridpoints.

Discussion of tunnel three
--------------------------

The third tunnel has a friction factor that is mimics the drag of the
block of stationary traffic.

Friction and fixed losses have been minimised in the tunnels, setting
a fixed Darcy friction factor of 0.00000001 (negligible) and turning
off the portal losses.  The tunnels have an area of 103 m^2 and a
perimeter of 55 m.

The friction in the sectype used to mimic the traffic has been
calculated as follows:

lambda = 0.00000001 + 4 * 0.00450314 / 55 * 103 = 0.03373262

The tunnel that has an 80 m long segment with high friction (instead
of traffic drag) differs from the tunnels with traffic drag as follows:

* air velocity at the left end of the tunnels with traffic drag are
  13.601616 m/s and 13.601621 m/s
* air velocity at the left end of tunnel three is 13.605539 m/s

The difference between these is 0.03%, which is low enough to confirm
that the traffic drag is behaving as it ought to.

Discussion of mass flows
------------------------

The mass flow through the tunnels is slightly above 1680 kg/s.
The graph on page 2 of the printout was generated to illustrate an
imbalance in the calculation.  It shows the mass flows left after
subtracting 1680 kg/s and multiplying what remains by 1000 (to turn
it into g/s).

All three show slight changes in mass flow, which is a concern.

In the tunnels with stationary traffic there is a slight drop in
mass flow (0.17 g/s in the first tunnel and 0.13 g/s in the second).
This represents a mismatch of 0.01%.

Using a shorter timestep (0.01 seconds instead of 0.1) leads to a
reduction in the mismatch (0.016 g/s) and also makes the two tunnels
have exactly the same calculated mass flows.


In the tunnel with a section of high friction instead of traffic,
there is a rise in mass flow: 1.05 g/s.  This is a mismatch of
0.06%.

Using a shorter timestep (0.01 seconds instead of 0.1) also leads
to a reduction in the mass imbalance: 0.114 g/s instead of 1.05 g/s.

We can conclude from this that the mass flow imbalances are due
to grid size.  The shorter the timestep, the shorter the cells
and the lower the mismatches are.  Given that we have mismatches
of 0.06% mass flow with a  timestep of 0.1 seconds, that is
considered acceptable.
