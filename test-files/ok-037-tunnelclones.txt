Test input file for Hobyah, a 1D tunnel vent program.
July 2024
A file that corresponds to the complex example system in Chapter 1 of the
Hobyah user manual, with 24 cross-passages instead of seven.

The "join" and "joins" commands in the westbound tunnel illustrate several
ways of creating joins:
  * the "join" command, with one chainage.
  * the "joins" command with a list of chainages that has spaces in it.
    The spaces mean that it has to be enclosed in double quotes.
  * the "joins" command with a list of chainages that does not have
    spaces in it, so it is not enclosed in double quotes.

The "tunnelclones" block illustrates how to create multiple tunnels
with a selection of sectypes.  It is intended for cross-passages
at regular intervals.

Note that both commands write the full text of the definition of each
join and tunnel to the log file in the ancillaries folder.
This is so that you can use "clonetunnels" block, copy the definitions
from the log file to an input file, then customise them.
