Hobyah.py
*--------
24 October 2024
---------------
Added a Windows executable file "Hobyah.exe" and a standalone installation
of Python in the subfolder "_internal" that the .exe file uses.

Added code to allow the script to be compiled into a Windows executable
file by the PyInstaller module and work with the multiprocessing module.

Added code to set the time and date of compilation manually, to bypass
a feature that does not work in executables compiled by the PyInstaller
module.  This is commented out in development code, but is uncommented
and updated in code uploaded to github.  The values are set in the
variable called "script_date".

Added print statements to identify whether the script succeeded in
loading the Fortran compressible flow routines (the binaries compiled
from compressible.f95 by f2py).

Corrected a bug in the processing of transient curves that caused error
6124 to not be raised when processing transient curves plotted from
.hbn files.

Corrected a bug in the processing of transient curves from SES files
in which the distance along a route was set by a constant, not a number.
The name of the constant used to appear in the autokey instead of the
value of the constant.


SESconv.py
*---------
24 October 2024
---------------
Added a Windows executable file "SESconv.exe" with a standalone installation
of Python in the subfolder "_internal" that the .exe file uses.

Added code to allow the script to be compiled into a Windows executable
file by the PyInstaller module and make the multiprocessing module work
with PyInstaller.

Added code to set the time and date of compilation manually, to bypass
a feature that does not work in executables compiled by the PyInstaller
module.  This is commented out in development code, but is uncommented
and updated in code uploaded to github.  The values are set in the
variable called "script_date".


classHobyah.py
*-------------
No changes.


classSES.py
*----------
24 October 2024
---------------
Modified calls in "WriteInputFile" to include the Boolean 'aur' in
some calls to "FormatInpLine" so that the optional comment is not
treated as the Boolean.
Modified "WriteInputFile" to only include the comment "Form 4A" at
the first instance of form 4 instead of all instances.
Modified "WriteInputFile" to turn off temperature derating in SVS
form 7C instead of having it on (mostly because IP2SI2IP.EXE turns
it off - not because I think temperature derating being off by
default is a good choice).
Corrected a bug in the writing of form 8E in which the counts of
decimal places were only set for files in US units.
Modified the comment for the fourth line of form 9G to account for
SVS train control option 3.

compressible.f95
*---------------
24 October 2024
---------------
Corrected an error in the comments.


generics.py
*----------


syntax.py
*--------


UScustomary.py
*-------------


generate-batch-files.py
*----------------------


_error-statements.py
*-------------------
This is an ancillary script that will only be of interest to those
who want to dig into the evidence validation requirement 2 in the
verification and validation document.  Requirement 2 reads:
  "Some errors donâ€™t have test files.  Document why those error
   messages have no test files."
The reasons are documented in the code comments on each line of the
definition of the variable named "no_testfile".  That's the only
reason to upload this script: to let people read the comments on each
line of entry in the definition of the "no_testfile".


slug-flow-quadratics.ods
*-----------------------
July 2023
---------
Corrected an error in the traffic blockage.  Changed the calculation and
notes to match the verification document.

Mar 2021
--------
No change to the calculation.  Altered the text descriptions of the
range and sanity checks to the correct rows.

Dec 2020
--------
Corrected the selection of which quadratic to use at slow vehicle speeds,
added a note about density 1.2 kg/m3.
