# Hobyah
Will eventually be a 1D tunnel ventilation program.

At the moment, all it does is open some text files and scan them for matching begin...end syntax.

Hobyah.py is the main program file.  Generics.py and syntax.py are ancillary routines that are likely to be used by several different main programs.

Named after the villains in a fairy tale from my pre-school days.
