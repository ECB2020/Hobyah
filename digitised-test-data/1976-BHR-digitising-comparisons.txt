This is a Hobyah input file for plotting measured and calculated transient
pressures from the following papers:

  "The measurement and interpretation of transient pressure generated by trains
  in tunnels", Gawthorpe, R G and Pope, C W, pages C35-C54 and Z28-Z30,
  Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on the Aerodynamics and
  Ventilation of Vehicle Tunnels (ISAVVT), 1976.

  "The use of airshafts for the alleviation of pressure transients in railway
  tunnels", Vardy, A E, pages C55-C69 and Z30-Z32, Proceedings of the 2nd
  International Symposium on the Aerodynamics and Ventilation of Vehicle
  Tunnels (ISAVVT), 1976.

Three of the curves in Figure 5 of the Gawthorpe and Pope paper (the curves
of static pressure at the tunnel walls 100 m, 500 m and 900 m from the entry
portal) are pretty much a standard comparison for anyone writing a new tunnel
ventilation program.

Figures 4 and 5 in the Vardy paper are from the same set of tests in the
Milford tunnel as Figures 7 and 8 in the Gawthorpe and Pope paper.  So I've
shown them at the same scale so that I can compare them.
The original source is an unpublished British Rail memo recording the
results of tests in the Milford tunnel:
  "Measurements of transient pressures caused by two trains passing in a
  tunnel", Myring, D, British Rail R&D Division, February 1972.

The Figures were scanned in, then loaded into a very capable online graph
digitisation website, https://automeris.io.  Points on the curves were
picked out manually and the data saved as .tar files.  The .tar files
can be loaded back into the automeris.io website for checking.
The values were saved on tabs in a spreadsheet and exported to .csv files
(which is where they are read by Hobyah when plotting).


This Hobyah input file has been set up to show the digitised data over
the top of the images that the curve data came from, to show how closely
they match (or not, as the case may be).

Note that both papers have curves of pressures measured from a pitot tube
attached to the nose of trains.  In the curves in the Gawthorpe & Pope
paper, the authors subtracted the dynamic pressure of the train speed:
those total pressure curves have zero pressure when the train enters the
tunnel.  In the Vardy paper's curves, the author did not subtract the
dynamic pressure of train speed, so those curves have approximately 1 kPa
registering on the pitot tube as the train enters.
