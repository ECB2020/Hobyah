This is a Hobyah input file for plotting measured transient pressures from
the following paper:

  "Pressure transient predictions in railway tunnel complexes", Fox, J A
   & Higton, N N, pages 97-114 and 643-644, 3rd International Symposium
   on the Aerodynamics and Ventilation of Vehicle Tunnels (ISAVVT), 1979.

The Figures were scanned in, then loaded into a very capable online graph
digitisation website, https://automeris.io.  Points on the curves were
picked out manually and the data saved as .tar files.  The .tar files
can be loaded back into the automeris.io website for checking.
The values were saved on tabs in a spreadsheet and exported to .csv files
(which is where they are read by Hobyah when plotting).

The measured data were all taken in Stanton tunnel by British Rail, who
fitted the tunnel with seven static pressure sensors: two inside the north
shaft, three south of the north shaft and four north of the north shaft.

This Hobyah input file has been set up to show the digitised data over
the top of the images that the curve data came from, to show how closely
they match (or not, as the case may be).
