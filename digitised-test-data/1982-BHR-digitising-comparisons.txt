This is a Hobyah input file for plotting measured transient pressures and
velocities from the following paper:

"An experimental investigation into the effect of train shape on the unsteady
flows generated in tunnels", Pope, C W, Gawthorpe R G, and Richards, S P,
paper C-2, Proceedings of the 4th Symposium on the Aerodynamics and Ventilation
of Vehicle Tunnels (ISAVVT), BHRA 1982 (pages 107 to 126).

The Figures were scanned in, then loaded into a very capable online graph
digitisation website, https://automeris.io.  Points on the curves were
picked out manually and the data saved as .tar files.  The .tar files
can be loaded back into the automeris.io website for checking.
The values were saved on tabs in a spreadsheet and exported to .csv files
(which is where they are read by Hobyah when plotting).

This Hobyah input file has been set up to show the digitised data over
the top of the images that the curve data came from, to show how closely
they match (or not, as the case may be).
