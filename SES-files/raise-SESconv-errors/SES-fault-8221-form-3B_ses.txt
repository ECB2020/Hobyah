                         SES v4.1 file for testing the raising of SESconv error messages.
                         This has entries in form 3B with zero length perimeters to the left of non-zero
                         perimeters, for illustrating a point and testing the raising of an SESconv
                         error message about incorrect calculation of mean roughness.
                         Segment 1 has four entries in form 3B, the last of which has zero perimeter.
                         Segment 52 also has the same four entries, but the third has zero perimeter.
                         Although the four pairs of numbers in segments 1 and 52 are the same, the
                         calculated mean roughness (and thus the segment friction factor) are not.
                         This is due to a bug in Lsins.for.  See section 14 of "SES-notes.pdf" for a
                         longer explanation of the bug.
