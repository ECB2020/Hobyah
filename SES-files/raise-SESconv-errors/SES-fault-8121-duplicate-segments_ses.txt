                         SES v4.1 file for testing a branch in SESconv.py.
                         This file is a run with two segments that have the same number.
                         The count of input errors is set to 1 to allow this clash to occur.
                         SES calculates fine (because of the one allowable input error).
                         SESconv.py complains because it can't distinguish between the two.
