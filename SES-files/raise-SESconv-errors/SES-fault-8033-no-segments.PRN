                         SES v4.1 file for testing a branch in SESconv.py.

                         This file has no sections or segments, just a train route with a train in

                         the open air.  It is not a good idea to use SES to model train performance

                         now that train performance programs like OpenTrack, TRAIN etc. exist.

                         This test file exercises a corner case, just to ensure that a suitable

                         error message is raised by SESconv.py when it processes this SES file's

                         output file.
