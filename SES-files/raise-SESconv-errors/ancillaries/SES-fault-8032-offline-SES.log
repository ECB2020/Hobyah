> You have chosen to set the option "-acceptwrong".

> The "-acceptwrong" option turns off some critical sanity checks
> and allows SES runs that are known to be wrong to be processed.
>
> The "-acceptwrong" option is intended to make things easier for
> programmers who are running modified SES code (e.g. executables
> in which SES v4.1 bugs have been fixed).
>
> Those programmers use it to check various things in modified
> versions of SES.  If you are not a programmer experienced in

> regret using the "-acceptwrong" option.
>
> Please run through this thought experiment:
>
>   Are you setting the "-acceptwrong" option while hiding your
>   use of it from your boss because admitting that the SES run
>   is wrong would make you or your boss lose face?
>
> If yes, you have my sympathy.  But I still recommend that you
> do not use the "-acceptwrong" option.  Either 'fess up, or find
> some other way to move slowly from your wrong runs towards a
> sane set of design calculations (difficult, but it can be done).

> Ok, you have been warned.  If you are not a competent Fortran
> programmer using this option with your eyes open, then on your

The run failed due to input errors, but will be processed as far as possible.
