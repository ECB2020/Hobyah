                                                  SIMULATION OF

                         SES file for raising a fault in SESconv.py.

                         This file has no header line or footer line (which is OK since

                         it is a .TMP file).  SESconv tries to gin up a fake footer from

                         the version number that comes after "NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK"

                         in the PBQD credits, but can't find it.  This is likely to be

                         raised when .PRN or .TMP files not created by SES are fed to

                         SESconv.py.
