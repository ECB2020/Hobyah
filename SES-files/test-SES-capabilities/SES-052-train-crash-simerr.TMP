                         SES v4.1 file with short tunnel and vent shaft.                                 

                         Case in which the net area of trains is higher than the area of the tunnel.     

                         This causes a simulation error and crashes the run.                             

                         Two trains are stationary together in the running tunnel.  The first            

                         scheduled train causes the area of trains to exceed the tunnel area.            

                         This file also has no temperature calculation.                                  

                         SESconv.py can process the .TMP file and show the user what's going             

                         on up until the timestep before the run crashes.

               THE COEFFICIENT MATRIX FOR THE SET OF AERODYNAMIC EQUATIONS IS NOT POSITIVE DEFINITE.
               THIS IS CAUSED BY:
                 1. THE TOTAL TRAIN CROSS SECTION AREA OVERLAPPING THE TUNNEL CROSS SECTION AREA(BLOCKAGE
                    RATIO GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO ONE) OR
                 2. THE TIME INTERVAL USED FOR THE INTEGRATION OF THE AERODYNAMIC EQUATIONS IS TOO LARGE.
