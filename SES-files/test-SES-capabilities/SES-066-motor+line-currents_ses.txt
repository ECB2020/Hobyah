                         SES v4.1 file with an example of a mismatch between motor and line currents.
                         This file has trains with eight motors per powered car.  The line currents
                         are limited to no more than twice the motor current when you print them.
                         This may be because SES is aimed at EMUs instead of locomotives, but if
                         you are modelling locomotive train performance you need to know about this
                         limitation.  See the printout of line currents in form 9H.
