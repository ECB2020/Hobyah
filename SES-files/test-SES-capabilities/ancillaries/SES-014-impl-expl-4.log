SES read all the input and started the calculation.
The run finished at the intended time and will be processed.
Checking the output file for SES error messages...didn't find any SES error messages.

> *Error* type 8031 ******************************
> There is a fatal problem with the input of "SES-014-impl-expl-4.PRN".
> The run uses train performance option 2 (explicit train
> speed and implicit brake/traction heat calculation). In
> SES version 4.1 the tractive effort calculation of train
> performance option 2 is too low by a factor of several
> hundred.  This is a bug in SES v4.1 routine Train.for.
> 
> Details of the bug are as follows:
> 
> SES calculates the tractive effort required to overcome
> the gradient resistance (variable name RG, tractive effort
> needed to climb a hill) and the curve resistance (variable
> name RC, friction at the flange-rail interface).  It does
> so by a call to Locate.for.
> Locate.for returns RG as a fraction of train mass and RC
> as lbs of flange drag on curves per short ton of train mass.
> 
> When using train performance option 1, SES v4.1 works
> properly.  It gets RG and RC from Locate.for as fractions
> of train mass (see line 185 of Train.for). It multiplies
> RG by train mass (line 193 of Train.for) and it multiplies
> RC by "train mass/2000" (line 194).  These factors put RG
> and RC into units suitable for the tractive effort
> calculation.
>
> But when using train performance option 2, SES v4.1 does
> not behave properly.  It gets RG and RC from Locate.for as
> fractions of train mass (at line 693) but does not multiply
> by the relevant factors.  Instead, it jumps to label 1100
> and starts assuming that RG and RC are already in suitable
> units.
>
> I came across the bug a few years ago when doing a freight
> rail tunnel.  We could see this 4,000 tonne train racing up
> a 1.6% incline with negligible tractive effort when we used
> train performance option 2.
> A bit of investigation showed that SES v4.1 exhibited the
> same behaviour, so we went looking for the cause and found
> the bug in Train.for in the SES v4.1 distribution.
>
> Your best bet is to switch to implicit train performance
> or (if you're up to the challenge) you can calculate the
> heat rejection yourself and use train performance option 3.
>
> You have set the "-acceptwrong" flag so the run will
> continue.  We've already printed a long spiel about how
> risky your choice was, so we won't harp on about it.
