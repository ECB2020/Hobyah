> You have chosen to set the option "-acceptwrong".

> The "-acceptwrong" option turns off some critical sanity checks

> The "-acceptwrong" option is intended to make things easier for
> programmers who are running modified SES code (e.g. executables

> Please run through this thought experiment:

>   Are you setting the "-acceptwrong" option while hiding your
