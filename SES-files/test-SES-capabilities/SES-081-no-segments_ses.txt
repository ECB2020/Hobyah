                         SES v4.1 file for testing a branch in SESconv.py.
                         This file has no sections or segments, just a train route with a train in
                         the open air.  It is not a good idea to use SES to model train performance
                         now that train performance programs like OpenTrack, TRAIN etc. exist.
                         This test file exercises a corner case, just to ensure that a suitable
                         error message is raised by SESconv.py when it processes this SES file's
                         output file.

                            AN ENTRY OF ZERO (0) HAS BEEN MADE FOR EACH OF THE FOLLOWING:

                            THIS INDICATES AN AT GRADE TRAIN PERFORMANCE SIMULATION ONLY
> There is a problem with the SES file "SES-081-no-segments.PRN".
> The run has no line segments or vent segments, which
> means that this run is intended to calculation traction
> power performance in the open air.
> SESconv.py does not handle runs that only calculate
> traction power performance in the open air.  It could
> handle them, but no-one who needs to do serious train
> performance calculations should be doing them in SES
> now that far more capable programs like OpenTrack or
> TRAIN are available.
