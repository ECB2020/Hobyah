# SES-files

The files in this folder are SES v4.1 runs used to investigate or illustrate SES capabilities in the Hobyah documentation.

Things like jet fans being at the back end of segments, why train performance option 2 miscalculates train performance, how axial fans are derated.

The folder "raise-SESconv-errors" holds SES input files and output files (some edited) that raise particular errors when the output files are fed to SEScon.py.

The folder "test-SES-capabilities" holds SES input files and output files that use most of the capabilities of SES.  These were used to develop SESconv.py.
