The files in this folder are scans of test reports from full-scale
tests of diesel freight trains running through two tunnels in northern
NSW.

The reason they are stored here in Hobyah is so that Engineering Heritage
Australia can copy the files.

The tests were carried out by the State Rail Authority (SRA) of New
South Wales in 1984 and 1985.

I happen to have them because a colleague was involved as a reviewer
on the Maldon-Port Kembla tunnel design in the 1980s.  When he retired
I acquired the contents of his bookshelf and found the reports there.



The 1984 tests involved running a train through the Zig Zag tunnels in
NSW, stopping the train in the longest (Zig Zag 10) and re-starting it.
An up run and a down run were made.

Temperature measurements were made in the tunnel and on and around the
train.  Air quality measurements were made inside the cabs.

The designers of the Maldon-Port Kembla did a simulation of the tests
with SES and wrote a report on it, which is also included.  The simulation
report alludes to an earlier test in the Richmond tunnel, a test that I
have no data on.



The 1985 tests involved running a similar train uphill through the Woy Woy
tunnel in northern NSW.  Three uphill runs were done, two with the driving
locomotives at notch 8 and one with them at notch 6.

One of the locomotives was fitted with temperature sensors to measure
engine air intake temperatures, inertial filter discharge temperature,
engine cooling water temperatures and radiator air intake temperatures.
Additional air temperature measurements were made alongside a coach
behind the front two locos, alongside a brake van at the back of the
consist and at a point in the tunnel (must have been a fun possession
for the folks tasked with taking those measurements!).

The results of the 1985 test resulted in the class 81 locos being modified
so that the engine air intake was lower down on the bodyshell.


In 2018 I managed to put the 1985 report through OCR (with some manual
work) and ended up with the numbers from the test in text files that I
could plot.  The replots, the source text files and the gnuplot file
that generates the plots is included.


The 1985 test data was used in a 2019 paper which I might as well spruik
here: the reference is C Jasper, D A Paradiso, D Edwards, "Tunnel and
ventilation design considerations for multiple head diesel locomotives",
18th International Symposium on Aerodynamics, Ventilation and Fire in
Tunnels, BHR Group 2019.
