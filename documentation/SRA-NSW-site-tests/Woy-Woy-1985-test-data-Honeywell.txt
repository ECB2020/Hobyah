# This file holds the temperature data recorded on the freight train run through the Woy Woy tunnel on the morning
# of 28 April 1985.  The data in this file is four air temperatures recorded from sensors on the outside of the
# brake van at the back of the consist, separated from the front two locos by 21 coal wagons and dynamometer
# car 1902.
#
# Refer to file "Woy-Woy-1985-test-data-Digistrip.txt" for more details of the test setup,
# observations about the test report and observations about the test results.
#
# This text file is in the same format as the typed-up test report (for checking).  The spreadsheet
# file "Woy-Woy-1985-test-data-Honeywell.ods" filters the data in this file into four text files (one for each
# of the four temperature sensors) that are suitable input to a plotting program such as gnuplot.
#
# This file also includes comments identifying when the staff aboard the brake van decided they had entered and
# exited the tunnel.  These are a useful cross-check of the locomotive speeds calculated from when the dynamometer
# car entered, exited, or passed a kilometre post.
