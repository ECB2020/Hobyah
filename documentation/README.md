# Hobyah documentation

This folder contains the following:

1) A User Manual for the Hobyah program,
2) a long-winded derivation of the method of characteristics (MoC) for isentropic compressible flow and a tedious explanation of how body forces in tunnel ventilation calculations can be implemented in it,
3) some notes on the SES (Subway Environment Simulation) program,
4) a partially completed document on the verification and validation of the calculation methods of the programs and spreadsheets in this github repository,
5) a rant about why giving friction factor the symbol 'f' is a really bad idea, and
6) some example output from Hobyah.py, intended to catch the casual reader's attention.
