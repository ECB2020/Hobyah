# Hobyah documentation

This folder contains the following:

1) A User Manual for the Hobyah program,
2) a long-winded derivation of the method of characteristics (MoC) for isentropic compressible flow and a tedious explanation of how body forces in tunnel ventilation calculations can be implemented in it,
3) some notes on the SES (Subway Environment Simulation) program,
4) a partially completed document on the verification and validation of the calculation methods of the programs and spreadsheets in this github repository,
5) a rant about why giving friction factor the symbol 'f' is a really bad idea, and
6) some example output from Hobyah.py, intended to catch the casual reader's attention.

The subfolder "SRA-NSW-site-tests" holds scans of full-scale test data of running diesel freight trains through NSW rail tunnels in the early 1980s (the Woy Woy and ZigZag 10 tunnels).  These are scans of paper documents I found whilst clearing out a retired colleague's bookcase in the early 2000s: my colleague had been sent them in the mid-1980s in relation to the design of the Avon tunnel near Port Kembla in NSW, with the note "these are the originals, please send them back to us".

The scans were added to this repository in late 2020 so that Engineering Heritage Australia could download them.
