# Old ventilation documents

The files in this folder are scans of reports and technical papers that relate to tunnel ventilation, large fans, temporary ventilation and mine ventilation.  All are documents that I acquired over the years and that I either find useful or reckon are of historical interest.

Most of these documents have insights or useful experimental data, but had such a small circulation when they were produced that - if knowledge hoarders like me don't post them online - they may be lost to future engineers.

The following is a summary of the contents of each.

## 1955-NCB-Bulletin-55-153-mine-ventilation-guidelines.pdf
Guidance produced by the UK National Coal Board (NCB) on the planning of ventilation of mines.  From the mid-1950s.  Has a 1971 NCB memo on metrication appended to it.

## 1969-Hinsley-C19th-coal-mine-ventilation.pdf
A review of fan development in the 19th and early 20th centuries, by a prominent 20th century mine ventilation engineer.

## 1970-Remond-Channel-Tunnel-Cooling.pdf
An early report on the ventilation and cooling problems of the Channel Tunnel (a 50 km rail tunnel between France and Britain).  Mostly worth reading because it summarises the results of two sets of thermal tests on train carriages and a set of aerodynamic tests on trains in tunnels:
1. a set of full-scale tests carried out to assess the heat transfer to/from the structure of trains in the climatic wind tunnel at Vienna Arsenal (VA).  The researchers put temperature sensors in different places on a train carriage, cooled the train carriage down to uniform temperature, then moved it into VA's rail environmental testing chamber and warmed the carriage up in different speeds of airflow (70 km/h and 110 km/h) while recording how quickly the temperatures at each thermocouple changed as the carriage warmed up.  The results of these experiments fed into every assessment of "heat transfer to/from the train structure" in European technical papers for the next few decades.
2. a set of full-scale tests that measured surface heat transfer coefficients on moving trains in tunnels and in the open air.
3. a set of full-scale tests that measured train drag in tunnels.

## 1973-air-curtain-model-test-report.pdf
A report on model testing of air curtain performance at draught relief shafts with inflow in rail tunnels.  Air curtains appear to be one of those dead ends that tunnel ventilation engineers investigated, tried out, and then abandoned.  But who knows?  With feedback control systems becoming ever easier to implement, actively-controlled air curtains may make a comeback.

## 1974-Edgell-MoC-non-homentropic-flow.pdf
A report on how to apply the 1D non-homentropic method of characteristics in tunnels and pipes (non-homentropic flow calculates temperature/wall heat transfer as well as velocity and pressure).  Useful because it was written by an engineer rather than a mathematician.

## 1979-MTR-overheating-train-tests-01-report.pdf to 1979-MTR-overheating-train-tests-06-report.pdf
Report on full-scale tests in which a Hong Kong MTR train was loaded up with weight (crates of railway sleepers), gas heaters and enough water boilers to represent a crush-loaded train full of sweaty passengers.  It was then repeatedly brought to rest in a tunnel in which the ventilation was operated in different configurations.
The aim was to test the ability of the tunnel ventilation system to keep the train's airconditioning system functioning under extreme conditions (the lower the airflow past the stopped train, the quicker the train aircon would fail).  The report has a lot of full-scale test data on the stratification of warm air around stalled trains running their airconditioning units under different airflow conditions, as well as the results of a test with no ventilation to see how long it took for the train air conditioning units to trip out.

## 1980-SES-v3-Users-Manual-sections-now-deleted.pdf
The SES (Subway Environment Simulation) version 3 User's Manual has a number of sections that were not included in the SES v4.1 User's Manual.  The sections in the SES 3 User's Manual that were not included in the SES v4.1 User's Manual are uploaded in this scan.  Page 2 of the pdf file has a summary of the contents.  The deleted sections might be useful to today's tunnel ventilation engineers, so it's worth uploading them here for future reference.

## 1980s-air-curtain-modelling-Tsuen-Wan.pdf
A few pages of an appendix to the tunnel ventilation design report of the Tsuen Wan extension (a rail tunnel in Hong Kong that used to use air curtains).  It describes how SES was modified to model air curtains (see also "1973-air-curtain-model-test-report.pdf").

## 1980s-Mine+tunnelling-vent-graphical.pdf
A set of course notes on mine ventilation engineering from a mining degree course in the United Kingdom.  I'd guess it was originally written in the 1970s and has annotations made in the 1980s.  It is an excellent introduction into how to figure out the duty points of different types of fans operating in series and in parallel.  Also has a comprehensive description of how to design temporary ventilation systems (a.k.a. construction ventilation systems) in which leaky air ducts feed air to the backups of tunnel boring machines or to a working face.

## 1982-diesel-freight-tunnel-Rogers-Pass-review.pdf
A review of the proposed ventilation system of the 14.5 km Rogers Pass diesel freight tunnel in Western Canada, written as part of the environmental assessment for the project.  A decent introduction to the ventilation of long freight tunnels served by long diesel freight trains and the problems associated with running diesel locomotives through tunnels.  Also, the ventilation system described in the report is pretty close to what was built once the Rogers Pass tunnel was constructed.

## 1984-ORE-C149-RP12-des-Bachees-tunnel-aero-tests.pdf
A report on full-scale experiments recording pressure and velocity in the "des Bachees" twin bore rail tunnel as a train passed another moving or stationary traion.  Has experimental data on rail tunnel transient pressures that may be useful for validating software calculations of pressure transients caused by train movements.

## 1987-transient-pressure-tests-on-rail-passengers.pdf
A report describing the reactions of test subjects who were placed in an environmental test chamber and were exposed to pressure fluctuations recorded during various types of train journey through tunnels.
This report was one of several that fed into the selection of the pressure comfort criteria used in the design of European high speed rail tunnels from the 1980s onwards.

## 1988-Simplon-tunnel-aero-tests-1-French.pdf, 1988-Simplon-tunnel-aero-tests-2-British.pdf and 1988-Simplon-tunnel-aero-tests-3-figures+graphs.pdf
A set of three linked pdf files.  The research arms of the French and British railways joined forces to carry out a set of aerodynamic tests with moving trains in the Simplon tunnel (between Switzerland and Italy).  The tests covered pressure loss coefficients for different types of cross-passages, air velocities in the cross-passages and rail tunnel, air velocities inside trains with all the inter-carriage doors open and air pressure differences across closed doors in trains.  The results were used to guide the design of the car transporter carriages and HGV transporter carriages used in the Channel Tunnel.

## 1992-BICC-cables-for-CT-test-programme-brochure.pdf
A description of how BICC (UK cable manufacturer) tested cable connectors to ensure they could handle air velocities up to 100 m/s and air pressure changes of up to +/-30 kPa ( specified for cable connectors in the Channel Tunnel).  An interesting description of how a supplier demonstrated that their equipment met some unusual environmental extremes (100 m/s and 30 kPa).

## Moody-chart-Darcy+Fanning.pdf and Moody-chart-Darcy+Fanning.png
A Moody chart that shows both Darcy friction factor (lambda) and Fanning friction factor (c_f).  The ambiguous symbol 'f' is not used for either friction factor.
